### Socio-historical Context and Impact Report ###

## -Research and describe how your project interacts with its socio-historical context. This section should address at least 3 out of the 4 bullet points below.##
## -Research the socio-historical context of your project to identify a few societal factors that could affect your data, prediction goal, and/or hypothesis. These factors might include current or historical policies, events, social conditions, larger societal systems, and more. Describe a few of the broader societal issues and their relationship to your data, prediction goal, and/or hypothesis. ##

Our project aims to explore the sleeping patterns of couples throughout the United States, in particular to see if we can identify trends or patterns in whether or not couples are more likely to sleep together or separately, based on observable factors/demographics such as age, income, marital status and length of relationship. For starters, we must acknowledge that any findings from this project cannot be extrapolated beyond the american context. It is important to realize that any trends observed are the result of cultural factors which are unique to the context in which it is observed. For example, in certain countries where pre-marital sex is prohibited or looked down upon, it would not make sense to try and generalize the findings in the US to those places. The relationships we are trying to explore can be very taboo and so any ‘causal effect’ identified can only be generalized to a context in which the cultural forces which shape how people behave are extremely similar. 

***Who are the major stakeholders in this project? What is your relationship to these stakeholders? Stakeholders are those who may be affected by or have an effect on your project topic. Some examples of stakeholders are a particular demographic group, residents of a particular geographic area, and people experiencing or at risk for a particular problem. Consider the following questions to help identify stakeholders:
Who does this project topic currently affect?***

Anyone interested in relationships or in a relationship, particularly those who think about their couple sleeping habits, ought to be interested in this type of topic.

***Who might be harmed by your research findings?***

If our findings happen to suggest that certain behaviors or demographics are more likely to observe undesirable outcomes with regards to couple sleeping habits, this may offend those groups or cause them concern. But in circumstances like that, we must remember, correlation is not causation!! Whenever people conduct research of this type, the motive must always be to help those in unfavorable situations, rather than to look for who to assign blame to when something goes bad. 

***Who might benefit from your research findings?***

Those same couples we mention above, in particular if we are able to identify causal effects as opposed to just trends and relationships. Perhaps it could help amend any unfavorable outcomes and change them for the better. 

***Summarize the most relevant technical or non-technical research that has already been conducted about your project topic. If relevant, what was the societal impact of existing research? A majority of the research on this topic is centered around two main themes/questions.***

The first looks to assess the commonality of couples sleeping separately, as well as the reasoning behind why this may differ across couples. The second seeks to focus more on the benefits and disadvantages associated with it through analysis of the reasons for which couples do or do not sleep together. For example, certain studies have found that over 60% of american couples sleep together, an interesting feat. What is even more interesting is that from an objective stance, people actually sleep worse with a partner!

***Discuss the impact of your socio-historical research findings on your project. Consider the following questions to help identify at least one impact:
How does this context affect how you should frame your question?***

We are not looking to see what kinds of people have more problematic relationships by proxying with their sleeping habits, in the aims of vilifying them. We are looking to help those who are unhappy with their sleeping arrangements by identifying some trends/causes, or hopefully helping people who feel anxious about their sleeping habits to feel normal by showing them that many other people also have non-traditional couple sleeping habits, and are quite happy with it!

***How does this context affect how you should analyze your data?***
An important consideration is to make sure to erase sensitive data unless you absolutely need it. For example, there is no need to see the people’s names, or their exact locations (a general region is more than sufficient for our purposes). We should be cautious of whether or not we need variables such as race, and if we do, what we would be doing with them and whether it causes more harm than good.

Like we stated previously, the aim is to aid and not shame.

***How does this context affect how you should interpret your findings?*** 
If we observe trends among certain demographics. First we ask ourselves if the implications are benign or not. If they are, we can interpret them as we see it. If they are potentially harmful however, we must be careful in ensuring we understand correlation is not causation. Certain demographics may be correlated with certain outcomes due to confounding variables that we do not understand nor observe, so we should not be too quick to judge. 

***How does this context affect how you should present your results?***
Building off of the previous answer, we should present it in a context which seeks to understand with the intent of helping, and without assigning blame. If we observe that a group experiences more undesirable outcomes, we frame it in a manner which shows we are concerned about their wellbeing and wish to help (if they want it), and not in a manner which seeks to blame them for their outcomes.

## Ethical Considerations ##
## Discuss a few ethical and societal issues related to your data and analysis. This section should address at least 4 out of the 6 bullet points below. Focus on the questions that feel most relevant to your project.

***What kind of underlying historical or societal biases might your data contain? How can this bias be mitigated?***
 
***Were the systems and processes used to collect the data biased against any groups?***

Our data was collected by querying a SurveyMonkey audience and therefore individuals without access to the internet and thus SurveyMonkey are not represented. Since the majority of those who do not have internet access are people living in poverty, it is likely that people living in poverty are not represented in our dataset. This bias could be mitigated by conducting randomized in person interviews in order to enrich the dataset. 

***What biases might exist in your interpretation of the data?***

***What assumptions might influence your decision-making across the data life cycle (choices about which data sources to use, how to deal with missing data, etc.)?***

***How does your identity, prior knowledge, and perspective inform your analysis?***

One common bias that might influence our data analysis is our shared belief that couples in strong relationships share a bed if living under the same roof. We might, therefore, be prone to considering other factors as weak. 
	
***How could an individual or particular community’s privacy be affected by the aggregation or analysis of your data?***
 
If the anonymous people in our dataset are identified by a hacker, then their sleeping arrangements with their romantic partner and their relationship status will be available to the public. This however cannot be done through our dataset that would have to happen through the SurveyMonkey survers. This can be particularly detrimental to people who want to keep their relationships a secret especially if their safety or freedoms can be compromised due to their sexual orientation. 

***Is data being used in a manner agreed to by the individuals who provided the data?***
	
Yes. Individuals provided the data in order to provide insight into the sleeping arrangements of American couples, these couples are in partnership with SurveyMonkey.  
 
***What are possible misinterpretations or misuses of your project results and what can be done to prevent them?***
	
Our project uses data collected in the USA. Some might use our project results outside the USA context. We will prevent this by making sure anyone who sees our work is aware that our data came from a very small sample of American couples and therefore our results should be read with a grain of salt and should not be seen to reflect couples outside the American context. 
Add your own: if there is an ethical or societal issue about your project you would like to discuss or explain further, feel free to do so.
